# Bank-Sauga case
    This analytical report summarizes my findings of flow of customers at different time intervals coming the bank during, and my recommendations on how to solve the long waiting line issues. 

To begin with, the given data has no NoN-values, meaning that the given file doesn’t have any missing values, so the analysis made is accurate. As banks operate for 8 hours, from 9 am to 5 pm on weekdays and from 9 am to 12 pm on Saturdays, there is a total of 43 hours working for one bank branch. There are four operating branches, each with a different number of customers during the week. The file has 430 entries, meaning the information is based on ten weeks or 2.5 months.

As we can see from our data, our main branch has the highest number of customers during the ten weeks, also worth mentioning that the other three branches have a slight difference in the total number of customers among each other. Branch 1, which is the second most visited branch, has 11767 customers, whereas the least visited branch (third) has 11668 customers. There is a slight difference of only 0.8 percent. With this information, customers tend to choose the main branch with a mean of 53.46 customers per hour, whereas in the first, second, and third branches, it is only 27.37, 27.29, and 27.13, respectively. Moreover, we can see a positive correlation between the customers coming to one of the bank branches when the day is getting closer to Saturday. Friday and Saturday are the busiest time to go to banks since it is assumed that people are extremely busy during the mid-week, so they tend to go to the bank after they finish most of their workload. Even though the branches are open for only 3 hours on Saturday, Saturdays are considered the most intensive days. The average number of customers in the main branch on Saturdays is 91 people in one hour, which is approximately twice more significant as the results on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Fridays are almost as busy as Saturdays, with only about 19-21% fewer people coming. They are considered the second most intensive day among all six working days. 

The minimum number of customers during an hour of working on Saturdays is 41, which happened during the second week of tracking from 10 am to 11 am, which is almost as big as the maximum number during Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in the first branch. Branch 1 has the lowest amount of customers on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Also, comparing the first branch to the second and third branches, the average amount is approximately more considerable by only 1-2 customers. The difference is not significant, but by this, we can understand that branch 1 is the second most popular branch on Fridays and Saturdays. Also, after comparing the maximum and the minimum number of customers coming in a particular timeslot, it is noteworthy that, in the majority of the weeks in the given data, 10 am to 11 am and 3 pm to 4 pm timeslots are the least suitable for customers. 
The most considerable flow of people is from noon to 1. People tend to come most at this time, no matter what branch it is. However, since Saturdays banks close at noon, most people come from 9 am to 10 pm. At the same time, interesting to mention that there is a vast difference in the number of customers one hour after the peak, which is from 1 pm to 2 pm on weekdays and from 10 am to 11 am on weekends. A significant drop can depend on people going for lunch and taking work breaks. The boxplots show that during week 1, the second and third branches have one outlier that can be explained with only one peak. In contrast, in the main and first branches, there are two or more outliers, meaning that the situation with customers isn’t stable enough. The bank employees fail to serve the customers on time, leading to big queues and customer dissatisfaction. We can observe that there are still many outliers during all ten weeks. There was no single week that did not have one. This can be explained as the situation not changing. There are still big lines which eventually will lead to customer dissatisfaction.

After the precise statistical analysis, I have a few suggestions that can help to improve the current situation. Our goal is to improve customer retention. To achieve that we have to significantly change the customer services so that more and more customers will be satisfied. We want to decrease the waiting lines in the queues as much as possible. 

I have a solution that will improve the current situation. People come to banks for entirely different reasons, and it can be anything, withdrawing or depositing cash, depositing a cheque, asking for advice for future investments, or opening a savings account. I believe that the best solution is to digitalize the whole banking system. To find the best programmers in the market and develop an app that will have the whole banking system inside. First, the app will minimize your movements. As I mentioned before, people have different reasons for going to a bank if they have simple inquiries or are in need of just opening a savings account. It can now all be done through the app, there will be online consultants for all the questions to be resolved. The second answer to this problem is to have more ATMs all over the city with low service fees. So that people will go to banks for more significant issues that can not be solved.
