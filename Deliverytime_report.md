# Delivery Times and GoldenHouse Restaurant 
    This is a statistical report, where data will be explained, followed by an effective recommendation for a GoldenHouse restaurant.
GoldenHouse restaurant specializes in Chinese cuisine and has a delivery service for its customers. Lately, the restaurant has received many complaints about the delivery service, that the food is being delivered late. Afterward, GoldenHouse restaurant collected some data from orders during peak time. Since there were many complaints, the restaurant is in the process of choosing a marketing plan that will lead to customer retention. This involves a 10$ free coupon if the delivery is not on time. 

The GoldenHouse restaurant wants to improve the current situation, they want to return the trust of customers. There are four new deliverers. The restaurant is concerned that some new deliverers are slower than others. With the help of statistical analysis, precise details will be given on the data. The deliverers had different orders and locations. The most considerable average distance covered was by the second deliverer, with a result of 7.26 miles, while the lowest distance covered was by the first deliverer. His average distance for all orders was 5.53 miles. Even though the distances were different, it almost took the same time to prepare the order. On average, it takes from 11-12 minutes to prepare it. The speeds for all four deliverers are entirely different. From the analyses, we can see that the fastest one was the second deliverer, he had an average speed of 0.5 miles per minute, and his highest recorded speed was 0.67 miles per minute. In contrast, the first deliverer had a slightly lower average, minimum and maximum speed than the second one, with only 0.44 m/pm, 0.31 m/pm, and 0.57 m/pm, respectively. Third and fourth had the lowest performance compared to the previous deliverers. Driver 3 and driver 4’s maximum reached speed is 0.46 m/pm and 0.43m/pm, which is not even as high as the mean speed of the first and second deliverers. It is also worth mentioning that the lowest reached speed for the second deliverer was 0.36 m/pm. It is still faster compared to the average speed of the third and fourth delivery man. 

With that said, we can confirm Goldenhouses' concern about the current situation. Indeed, there is an entirely different performance from new deliverers. First and second are showing promising results, while third and fourth are taking too much time to deliver the order. We can see that the first and fourth deliverers had almost the same distance covered on average. In contrast, the speed of delivery is entirely different, and the second driver has almost 1.5 times faster performance. The fourth driver had the worst performance.

We want to return the customers' trust, saying that if the delivery exceeds the time we told our customers, the 10$ coupon will be provided as compensation. There are two marketing suggestions to implement, having a constant time for everyone M, which we guarantee to deliver if the order is within a 10-mile range. The second option will make the promotion even for everyone. Its’ idea to deliver the order using a simple formula 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐷𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒=(14.8+2.06 × 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 )+ 5(extra minutes), the promotion will be valid even for those who are beyond a 10-mile range. 
  
As we said earlier, the first and second drivers had the fastest delivery time. So we can make our current analyses based on their performance. Let M be equal to 40 minutes. Based on the information from scatterplots, it is evident that within a 10-mile range there were only 4 cases where deliverers exceeded the given time. Three out of four orders were for the fourth deliverer and one for the third deliverer. In this situation, we would have lost 40$ worth of coupons. Nevertheless, the disadvantage of this promotion is that it is not targeting all customers. Most people will not be able to be part of the promotion. It is also not intended for unexpected situations if the delivery location is quite far. This policy is effective if we do not want to actually give coupons to customers. Fairly saying, the reason why most of the orders were not delivered on time is simply because of poor performance from third and fourth deliverers. If the same orders had been taken by the first or second, there would have been much less chance that it would exceed 40 minutes of delivery. 
  
The second option relies more on how fast the driver will deliver the order. Using the information from the boxplot, there was a case of one outlier, when the time that they were preparing the order was more than 18 minutes when the average was only 11.51 minutes for all 76 orders, the second driver still managed to give the order in time. From the scatterplots, we can see that the third and fourth were the only ones who came later than the expected time again. This time, there were five and eight orders for the third deliverer and fourth deliver, respectively. In total, GoldenHouse restaurant would have lost 130$ worth of coupons. It is noteworthy saying that the boxplot for the fourth deliverer is the only right-skewed, meaning that he has the highest average of time spent preparing food. 
	In conclusion, after evaluating both promotion methods, I believe the second option will be the most effective method. Since we are not only targeting people that are within a 10-mile range, we have a bigger opportunity to get much more customers. I believe that if we have fair promotions for all of the customers, more people will eventually want to try ordering the food and be part of exciting promotion based on their location. This promotion can lead to higher company recognition. Moreover, we can confidently say that if we have deliverers that are like the first or the second driver, there will be no cases of receiving complaints that took longer to deliver than expected.
